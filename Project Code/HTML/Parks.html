        <h2 class = "headermargin">Devil's Lake State Park</h2> 
        <p class = "pmargin">
            Devils Lake State Park is very popular state park here in Wisconsin. The park
            has a lot to offer on a day trip ranging from many miles of trails to hike, rocks to
            climb, as well as a large lake in the heart of the park. Located in Baraboo, Devil's Lake is 
            a beautiful park that can be visited many times before it gets old. There is a lot of space
            to roam there and it can prove challenging to people who consider themselves to be 
            beginners. Trails have a wide range of elevation differences making for a tough hike.
            For those who want even more of a challenge, there are many rock bluffs within the park
            boasting hundreds of feet of large rocks that can be climbed up to the top, where visitors
            will find themselves with a trail to ease their way back down. Overall this park has a lot
            of different opportunities for many different kinds of people and can be a fun day trip
            alone or with a friend.

        <h2 class = "headermargin">Scuppernong Trails</h2>
        <p class = "pmargin">
            Located in the Kettle Moraine State Forest is a more friendly set of trails, called the 
            Scuppernong Trails. While there is less variety found here than at Devils Lake, here 
            there is a nice selection of trails ranging from 2.4 miles, up to 5.8 miles. The terrain here 
            is much easier to navigate with less ups and downs making for a good place for a nice leisurely
            stroll. If you are feeling adventurous enough here there is even access to the ice age trail 
            which is a trail that runs through the state of Wisconsin, hosting hundreds upon hundreds of miles
            of trails to walk. Whether you are looking for a good place to walk the dog or maybe to get your 
            steps in, Scuppernong Trails are a great option for anyone.

        <h2 class = headermargin>Ledge Park</h2>
        <p class = "pmargin">
            Horicon Wisconsin's Ledge Park is something of a nice mix between Devils Lake and Scuppernong.
            While there are some trails found at this park that can be completed by most people, there are
            some that a bit tougher than others. What this park also shares with Devils Lake is the rock 
            climbing aspect. While at a much smaller scale, Ledge park has rock formations that can be 
            climbed up if you are looking for something more challenging. these small cliffs  aren't as 
            defined for climbing the rock bluffs at Devils Lake though so caution should be taken when 
            attempting to climb the rocks at Ledge Park. This park is great for a wide range of people 
            and can offer a great experience to anyone who might just be looking for a place to hike, to 
            those looking for a bit more of a challenge.
