            of any fiteness level, while others may be for those who are looking for something 
            of a workout. All year round these park are open to the public and make a great day trip

        <h2 class = headermargin>Trails</h2>
        <p class = "paramargin">
            Of the parks that are offered here, there are many different trails that can be used
            that go from a nice walk to a strenuous climb. For example, you have the Scuppernong 
            trails in the Kettle Moraine State Forest that have multiple options that are all
            relatively easy for most people. On the other end here you can find information on 
            Devil's Lake State Park. The trails found at Devil's Lake are much more difficult than
            the one's found in the Kettle Moraine State Forest. The trails are much more ups and 
            downs and will give a harder time. There also are great spots for rock climbing that
            can offer a good challenge, along with a large lake if hiking isn't for you. Overall,
            there is a great deal of opportunities found within all of the trails within these
            parks.
