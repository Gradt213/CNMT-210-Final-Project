        <h2 class = "headermargin">Trails at Devils Lake</h2> 
        <p class = "pmargin">
            There is a wide variety of trails offered at Devils Lake ranging from easy all to way to 
            a strenuous hike. These trails also offer a lot of different scenery whether you are looking
            for more floral hike or one with a lot more rock formations. One of the more popular trails 
            at this park would be the Balanced Rock Trail which is one of the more difficult trails at the 
            park with a very steep climb to the highlight of the hike which is a very large rock balanced
            on a much smalled point than its top. Another great trail is the Devil's Doorway Trail which is 
            a more moderate hike that while is only a short offshoot of another trail, offers another interesting 
            site. This trail shows a large doorway like feature made by many large rocks that offers a great view
            of the Lake through the doorway. If plantlife is more your speed then Grotto's Trail will be right up 
            your alley. It's an easy hike that offers a great view of a large oak forest. There is a lot of variety 
            at Devils Lake, ensuring that visitors will never have a dull moment.

        <h2 class = "headermargin">Trails at Scuppernong</h2>
        <p class = "pmargin">
            The easiest of the three parks listed here to hike at while having a smaller set of trails
            to choose from, the visit made to this park can be just as worthwhile as the others. To start,
            the first and easiest trail found here is the Red Loop. This trail is as the name entails, a 
            loop through the forest. This trail, only 2.8 miles long, offers a relatively easy hike with only a 
            few minor hills and a couple larger ones with lots of maps along the way to help keep you on track.
            The second trail is the Orange Loop which follows the same path as the first loop, but is extended 
            towards the middle of the Red Loop for a bit of a longer hike. The Green Loop which follows the
            first two is the most difficult of three, being the longest at 5.4 miles, as well as boasting more
            hills than the other two. All three of these trails have their own scenic overlook that can act
            as a resting point somewhere in the hike as well as offering a nice view to look at while taking 
            a rest.

        <h2 class = headermargin>Trails at Ledge Park</h2>
        <p class = "pmargin">
            Last but most certainly not least is Ledge Park. If you are looking for a park with moderately 
            easy trails and views similar to those at Devils Lake then you have come to the right place. Ledge
            Park, while being a relatively small park, has a lot to offer. There are a few trails such as the 
            Green Trail or the Red Trail that offer nice views of the park as well as the surrounding Horicon Marsh.
            Splitting most of the Red Trail is what gives this park its name is a steep ledge, roughly 50 feet in depth
            that can offer some fun rock climbing experiences as well as some great views. The overlook of the surrounding
            area as well as the Horicon Marsh is but one of the great things about this park that make it such a popular 
            spot, especially in the warmer months. You may want to watch your step on some of these trails however, especially
            with the ledge running along the Red Trail. Overall this park is a great place to stop for a few hours to get 
            some sightseeing in, as well as offering some great camping spots if that's more your speed.
